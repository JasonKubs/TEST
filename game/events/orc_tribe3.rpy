"Rowan found himself studying the tribe while Andras was occupied with convincing the orcs to join his soldier ranks."
"The place was little more than a camp of skin tents, haphazardly laid out with no apparent plan or regard for utility or defense.  Rowan suspected they'd just pitched them wherever they felt like it."
"The tactician in him couldn't help but criticize how open it left them to attacks.  Though orcs were not exactly a defensively minded race.  He couldn't remember a single time they'd actually tried to hold a defensive position against a siege or prolonged assault."
"There were numerous times when he, his men, or the heroes had come upon a camp not too dissimilar to this one where the orcs had come charging out to meet them head on in combat.  That or they'd fled in all directions, abandoning everything except their weapons and children."
"It had been said that a good defence is a good offense, but left to their own devices orcs forgoed defense entirely."

"There should have been orcs in the area. Frequent large footfalls through this particular stretch of otherwise very dense woods had choked out the plants and left a good path to follow."
"Rowan had been tracking the tribe for several hours now. Well, tracking was hardly necessary at this point. It had started with him finding their hunting grounds and following the trails they'd left since."
"Up ahead, he spotted a group of them. That confirmed what he'd hoped, though left him in an awkward position. There wasn't anywhere to hide on this trail and the forest brush on either side wasn't something he'd be able to make much headway in."
"There was a shout from the approaching group, so Rowan decided it was time to hurry in the only direction open to him. He was a human, prey as far as orcs were concerned until his demon Master arrived to give him safe passage through the tribe."
"A quick word through the amulet was all that was needed to indicate he'd found some orcs to recruit. Now he just needed to get somewhere where he could wait for Andras to make his way here from the nearest portal."
"Ten minutes later, he was cursing his luck. He'd gone around a turn and run straight into another group of orcs heading in the opposite direction."

"The speaker had a large deer slung over his shoulder and a bloody spear in his other hand. A moment after he spoke, the others fanned out and blocked any chance of running past them. Rowan put his hand on his pummel, sizing them up. Four plus the hunter with his deer."

femorc "Humie! Humie!"

"The other group came around the corner, pinning Rowan in. Now there were over a dozen of them, and he was surrounded."

femorc "Heh, caught you!"

"The green woman swaggered confidently up to Rowan, nodding at the other hunter."

"Upon returning to the tribe, the group broke up: the lead hunter went off to butcher his kill and most of the others went off to their respective tents. The remaining orc paraded Rowan around the camp to a few scattered cheers."
"The man bore it in stoic silence. He was not so helpless as they might believe."
"Soon the chief came to inspect the capture that had been said to be of interest to them. She towered over Rowan, wrapped in silk scraps and a vest of antlers lashed together. Pale white eyes glowered down at him from a sharp face with one broken fang."

orcc "Hmm, he is pretty humie boy. Got some nerve to him too, no tears or begging. Wonder how long dat will last?"
orcc "No one fucked him, right?"

"Her gaze had a look of great danger to it and there was a certain degree of apprehension when the guard insisted that no, Rowan had not been fucked by any of the other orcs. Yet."
"Her gaze softened and she returned to Rowan, inspecting his body and pulling off some of his clothing to reveal the scars underneath."

orcc "Oh? A warrior dis one. Well, warrior, you tink you can last wid me? I could use a toy dat can last all day."

"At the same time, Rowan was given a chance to observe her as well. More muscular than the typical female orc but not to the same extent as most males. Her breasts would easily fill a human's hand, although they looked about average on her large frame."

orcc "Say, do someden! Ya may be pretty, but ya ain't no fun."

"Being fucked in such a compromising position was surprisingly exotic and exhilarating. It certainly suited this orc chiefess to ride her conquests in such an amazonian way."

"She didn't wait for a response. Just let out a couple groans of her own while she stood up and stretched. This gave the man a chance to reposition himself into a much less uncomfortable orientation and finally get his bindings into his hands."
"She walked over to a case in the corner of the tent with her bits still exposed and dripping with a mixture of white and clear. When she returned, she was drinking from a leather flask. After taking a few sips, she pressed the skin to Rowan's lips and let him have a taste of watered down wine."
"While Rowan was not surprised when she plopped herself back down on top of him, her lips suddenly pressing against his own in a deep kiss was. The sudden romantic affection sent blood rushing back into his deflating member."

"The orc chief was worn out enough that he could finally take her on in a wrestling match, and her surprise at his sudden freedom was enough of an advantage to turn the bonds against his captor."
