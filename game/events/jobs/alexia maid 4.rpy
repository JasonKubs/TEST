"It was not that she had not seen a naked woman before. Or that there was something unusual about seeing a naked female body in the changing room. It was the specific naked female body she was staring at."
"Her body had clearly been heavily modified. Gleaming golden ring piercings hung from each nipple. But, that was just the start of it. There were a string of piercings at her navel as well. But, more shocking still was what was between her legs."
"A single small gold ring was clearly attached to her clit. But, other rings seemed to line each side of Mary’s lower walls. It was like her pussy had been built to be laced up."
"But, there were also all that tattoos. The word “Slave” written right above her privates. The pair of purple handprints etched around her breasts. And the image of two women engaging in...relations...tattooed in intimate detail on her side."
"Alexia just stood in place, shocked. Who would let their body be marked with such filthy...degrading...things. It made her look like such a slut…"

"She was pretty disconnected from the social circles of the servant’s quarter. Unlike them she stayed in the suites and could interact with anyone at any time. But, there was something sweet about their conversations about who was friends with who, and who was sleeping with who."
"It almost reminded her of gossip with the girls back at Arthdale. That reminder made her sad for a second when she remembered them. Almost like Arthdale. But, not Arthdale."
