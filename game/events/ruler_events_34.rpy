"A bright red hand was left on her rear. The first step towards the kind of bruises that would make it hurt for her to sit down."
"Before Liurial could steady herself, Rowan brought his hand down for a second and third time. A long involuntary groan slipped from her lips and she responded to each strike by wriggling beneath him." 
"Her involuntary process was flight like a small animal. But, the look on her face revealed all of her thoughts."
"Liurial was whimpering and gasping. Desperate sounds were being drawn from her lips with every strike. Another expression of mind numbing arousal and pain."
"The spankings continued, one after another. Rowan was always alternating position, always ensuring that a different spot felt the stinging pain. Liurial’s cheeks slowly drifted into a dark shade of red. Both her ass and her face."
"There was no escape from her. He had a duelist’s hands. Too strong to wrench free from his grasp. Too precise and skilled not to feel what he wanted her to feel. Stinging pain."

"The hidden forest trail stretched onwards into the distance like an emerald eternity." 
"There was something primal about this place, something virgin and unspoiled. Rowan could feel the life force of the whole world flowing through the earth beneath his feet, in the coiling roots between his toes." 
"He was at peace here, one with nature and the mother-forest that sheltered him in her protective embrace. Rowan lifted his nose and breathed in the moist forest air." 
"He paused. The scent of prey tickled his nostrils, leading like an unseen blood trail into the distance." 
"Rowan smiled to himself. His pack would eat well tonight."
"He took off into the brush, making sure to stay downwind of his prey. The quick-witted Wolf-kin followed the scent for over a mile, his heart pumping in his chest as he leapt over fallen trees and sprinted between the gaps of thorn bushes."
"Rowan stopped dead. The scent of prey was all around him. He tensed himself to strike, watching like a hawk for any change in scenery."
"Then, a movement: a flash of tan fur amidst the sea of green foliage. The chase was on."
"A predatory instinct Rowan could neither define nor control compelled him to pursuit. His legs moved with the blinding speed of a beast on the hunt, his mind fixed to the target in front of him: his prey, his meal."
"The Deer stood no chance. It had spotted him far too late. It’s fight-or-flight instincts were useless against a being as deadly as Rowan."
"His claws were like scimitars, his teeth like ripping daggers. He was faster, stronger, {i}smarter{/i} than his prey. This was the logical state of being: the strong survived, the weak served to strengthen and feed. And Rowan was indeed strong."
"He closed the distance in seconds as the Buck leapt high to escape his snapping jaws. Rowan was so close, he was nipping at its back legs-"
"A white blur descended from an unseen angle in the forest canopy above. Rowan skidded to a stop, his honed instincts warning him of imminent danger."
"A second predator entered the fray. The white blur leapt from the branches above and pounced on the blindsided Buck. Rowan’s mind caught up with his instincts, recognizing the white-furred predator to be a Wolf-kin like him." 
"The interloper tackled the Buck, using her weight and momentum to bring it crashing to the ground. The Buck let out a cry, blood fountaining into the air as the White Wolf latched her teeth around its neck and tore its throat out. A few shakes and a second bite, and the Deer lay motionless upon the ground."

"The intruder wolf’s yellow eyes focused upon him, baring her fangs to ward off her competitor. Rowan let out a threatening roar, and she responded in kind, snarling at him. The two circled each other, the dead Buck separating the two rivals as they prepared to fight for the right of the kill."
"Rowan charged at the same time she did, meeting somewhere in the middle as they became an indistinguishable pile of gnashing teeth and flared fur."
"The contest was fierce: when he slashed at her stomach, she bit him on the shoulder. When Rowan attacked her from the side, the White Wolf snapped at his hind legs."
"The two fought like animals caught in a death spiral: neither willing to return to their pack empty handed. Both ready to fight to the death rather than cede dominance to the other."
"The battle went on and on, far longer than bestial logic or survival instinct would normally allow in such a contest."
"At last, Rowan used his superior weight and size to leap atop her, pinning her to the ground with his arms as she nipped and roared and snarled at him. Despite his wounds, he had gotten the better of her. Yet still she struggled."

        "After a last, frantic effort to free herself she collapsed against the ground, unable to maintain her feeble resistance. Rowan reveled in the feeling of putting his rival in her proper place: helpless, terror-stricken, unable to resist his might." 
        "Rowan ran a claw across her cheek as she shuddered, powerless to stop him. The White Wolf let out a whine and bared her neck to him, a sign of utter submission. Her yellow eyes never left his as they both panted from the exertion."

"Rowan snapped his jaws in her face as a final warning and then withdrew, moving to secure his hard-fought kill." 
"The moment he was off of her, the White Wolf moved to bolt into the underbrush. He let out a low growl of warning. She gave a second, longer whine and sat back on her haunches."
"The White Wolf watched in submissive silence as he took hold of the dead deer between his jaws and began to drag it towards his family’s den." 
"Rowan cast a long look over his shoulder at the conquered Huntress, letting out a commanding growl between his teeth. He gestured with his head in the direction he was headed, then disappeared into the underbrush."

"Time passed. There was no way of quantifying the changing of seasons to his kind. Only a vague, instinctive appreciation of the shifting nature of the hunt as the weather cooled, the leaves changed color, and game became more scarce."
"Rowan had outgrown his original family, separating from his birth pack and his Alpha father when it became clear he was no longer welcome."

"The time had come for him to set out on his own in search of new territory to hunt. When he left the pack, the White Wolf followed along after him, silent and watchful as always." 
"She had become his faithful companion: traveling with him, hunting with him, sharing the warmth of their body heat in the depths of the night. He had come to rely on her, and she in turn had learned to share her meals."
"Their pecking order had been clearly established by that first, intense encounter: he led, and she followed. They protected each other. Such was the way of things. They had become quite the pair."
"One day, late in the afternoon as they coaxed a hare away from its burrow in tandem, Rowan caught wind of a scent that he had never smelled before."
"Just as he flushed the floppy-eared prey from cover, he sniffed something sweet upon the wind. His head snapped around, craning his neck to stare at the White Wolf. Her rump was turned towards him, her tail held high as she chased after the tiny creature, catching it in her jaws. "
"The White Wolf grinned in excitement through the meat in her teeth. She loped over to him and spat the hare out at his feet, her eyes alight with joy at having brought him the kill."

        "Rowan stared hungrily at the White Wolf, feeling a gnawing need build in his gut. He had conquered her: submitted her will to him as the superior specimen all those months ago. And now she did as her Alpha bid, following where his whims took them."
        "Rowan prowled around her, his tongue hanging out of his mouth as he felt heat build in his loins. Taken aback by her partner’s sudden aggression the White Wolf froze, paralyzed by his hungry gaze. He lifted his head and took a deep inhale, sensing her tense back."

"He circled her a second time, pausing this time to stare at her ripe breasts and juicy hindquarters, noting that the scent was coming strongest from her rear. She stood stock still in place, as if she were prey readying to bolt, but the White Wolf did not move an inch without his permission."
"He approached her from behind, sniffing, sniffing at the sweet scent she gave off. He put his nose against her pink slit and inhaled deeply, his nostrils flaring at the erotic scent. The White Wolf whimpered at the feel of his breath against her genitals."
"Rowan felt a rush of adrenaline, his nose burying itself into her rump as he breathed in the intoxicating scent coming from her cunny. He gave an experimental lick, marveling at the sweet nectar that leaked from her femininity."
"The White Wolf let out a moan, hiking up her ass so that Rowan might have easier access to her nethers. It seemed she liked his touch."
"Rowan began to lick and slide his tongue up and down her lower lips, his mind awash with primal urges as his cock grew painfully erect beneath him."
"Her pheromones were unbearable, like a fire burning from the inside that had caught the dry brush of Rowan’s mind ablaze in its destructive path."
"He buried his face in her pussy, licking with wild abandon as he growled and nipped and bit at her plush butt. Far from being angry, the White Wolf mewled with hungry need, forgetting entirely the hare and their meal in place of this new, wonderful thing they had discovered."
"Rowan spread her ass, slathering her with kisses and licks until her crotch was soaked and she was crying out with pleasure. The noise rebounded across the forest clearing with a loud, cacophonous echo. They’d likely scared away the game for miles around; Rowan couldn’t care less."
"The White Wolf’s upper body went to the ground, her arms clinging to the uneven forest floor as Rowan lapped again and again at her sweltering honeypot."
"Rowan was getting dizzy, pussy-drunk on the scent of the pheromones she exuded from her muff. He was rock hard, dribbling precum from his cockhead and humping the air in desperation for release."
"Flush with animal need, he mounted her, pistoning his hips at such a frantic pace that Rowan slipped and missed on his first stroke, the topside of his cock slathering across her slick slit and coating it in her feminine juices."
"The White Wolf gasped, her body tensing with anticipation at their impending mating. She humped back against him, as eager to quench her heat as he was to fill her. It only complicated the delicate biological process as he slipped and slid his turgid length across her hot, wet snatch."
"Frustrated in a way only a rutting male could be, Rowan drew back his hips, let loose a bellowing roar, and speared her entrance with his cock. The White Wolf’s head lifted from the ground, her ears standing on end as she let out a cry of half-pain, half-ecstasy."
"Rowan adjusted his weight, reveling in the warm, wet conquest of his pack mate. She whimpered beneath him, her pussy tightening, squeezing his cock like a vice. The pleasing sensation urged him onwards, and before Rowan’s conscious mind had time to process he was thrusting into her depths."
"They moved as one, rolling their hips together in a hypnotic rhythm that was not borne of experience, but basic instinct. The White Wolf let out a gasp, her arms going out from under her as she lifted her ass in the air to further facilitate Rowan’s rough fucking." 
"There was a wet {i}squelch{/i} every time he hilted within her. Each time he hit that particular depth she let out a scream of orgiastic approval. They mated like beasts beneath the boughs, thrusting and bucking against one another with little subtlety and less restraint." 
"Rowan picked up the pace, his hands reaching around her to grope at her chest and her hanging teats. The White Wolf groaned, helpless to the sensation of being roughly taken like a bitch in heat." 
"Rowan laid himself atop her, smothering her with his weight, claiming her as his own. She submitted to him, bucking her hips back against him in tune to his aggressive thrusts." 
"The two fell into a natural sync, their bodies molding together in a manner reminiscent of their conflict, months before. Only this time, the growls and yips were of an altogether different nature."
"She spread her legs apart and lifted her tail higher in a show of submissiveness. Rowan responded by taking hold of her shoulder firmly but gently with his teeth, holding her in tight place as he slapped his hips hard against her ass."
"He felt the swelling of his base grow and grow, his knot thickening with blood as he bottomed out within her. His knot bumped against her pussy lips, the engorged meat {i}squeezing{/i} tight between the narrow gap of her pussy. Rowan let out a growl, building to a roar. His knot slid into her folds with a loud {i}pop{/i}."
"{i}She is mine{/i}. That was the thought that repeated like a mantra in Rowan’s head as he hilted and came."
"He felt a rush of feminine fluids coat his crotch as the White Wolf orgasmed in tune to his own climax. There was a triumphant thrill of conquest as he ejaculated, a sense of biological accomplishment. His hot cum squirted deep into her pussy, filling her fertile womb with his impregnating seed."
"They had created a new life in that moment, Rowan felt it in the depths of his soul. The very wind in the trees changed their direction to tell him so."

They were now irrevocably tied together: his cock letting loose further spurts inside her womanhood as her pussy gently massaged more cum from his balls."
        "Still tied at the groin, the two collapsed together against the earth. Rowan was more exhausted now than he’d been after their first, contentious encounter. The White Wolf huddled into his arms, sharing her warmth with him in the heady afterglow."
        "Again, the yellow eyes. They were the strangest thing about her. More than her strength, or even her beauty, her contemplative gaze was what fascinated Rowan the most. She stared at him with something approaching contentment, and perhaps even a little bit of possessive pride."

        "As his balls pulsed and his knot swelled Rowan imagined his virile seed working its way into her, filling her with his cubs. The White Wolf was his, now and forever."
        "He laid atop her, pinning her to the ground for hours on end until his knot popped free from her dribbling pussy. She glanced up at him, letting out a submissive gasp as her yellow eyes fluttered and her ears pulled back against her head."
        "{i}She is mine{/i}. He thought again, growling in her ear as he breathed in the intoxicating scent of her hair."
        
"The seasons changed again. New life sprang into being as the cold of winter gave way to the bliss of spring. The White Wolf’s belly swelled, her breasts grew heavy with milk, and for a time Rowan hunted alone through the woods to feed the both of them."
"She soon gave birth to a trio of daughters: all white haired, with hazel eyes the color of their father’s. Rowan was overjoyed."
"Weeks passed; months; years. Seasons came and seasons went. Rowan’s pack grew and grew, his cubs growing and multiplying as he and his White Wolf hunted and mated and lived their lives as all Wolf-kin should: free and happy beneath the sheltering boughs of the mother-forest."
"Rowan looked on with pride as his sons and daughters matured and split off from the pack, embarking on the same journey of discovery that he and his love had once taken together, so very long ago." 
"More time passed, and the mighty patriarch grew old and grey, his claws dulling and his speed slowing. His old strength failed him, and for the first time since he was a pup, he found himself unable to keep up with the pack."
"Yet beyond all natural logic, the White Wolf still followed him. Even when he grew too weak to lead, and handed down leadership to his eldest remaining son."
"Then, one day, he could hunt no more. On an old family trail, the very same trail where he once had tried to pursue a fleeing Buck, Rowan collapsed to the ground, his breath going faint and his eyes fading."
"He looked up from his dazed stupor, and there was the White Wolf, bent over him, loyal as always. There was a soft expression in her yellow eyes. She stroked his face, her claws running through his hair and scratching behind his ear, just like he loved it."

"He stopped at the sight of a stare-off between his secretary and the castle beastmaster.  Both of them were frozen to the spot, staring one another down.  A moment passed, but before Rowan could speak again Liurial let out a sudden shriek!"

liur "D-d-dark elf! Monster! Murderer!"

ro "Liurial, pull yourself together girl."

"Draith wasn't doing much better, as he'd also taken to cowering behind Rowan, covering his face with his hands and muttering to himself."

ro "Liurial.  Liurial, look at me."

"Finally her gaze focused on his and at last she seemed to relax.  One of her soft hands went over his and she seemed to take comfort in his familiar touch.  That was good enough for Rowan."

ro "Draith, no one is going to hurt you.  You're safe."

"The beastmaster nodded, evidently getting his wits about him once more.  He took a steady breath, smiled nervously, then nodded again.  At least some confidence had been instilled in the dark elf."

ro "Liurial, this is Draith.  He is the castle beastmaster and serves the twins.  He isn't your enemy, he isn't going to hurt you."

"Rowan waited for her to blink back her tears and respond."

liur "Okay, I trust you."

"Then he turned his attention back to Draith."

ro "Draith, this is Liurial, she's my secretary now.  She answers to me.  I won't let her order you around or try to punish you."

dra "If you say so."

"Satisfied that the situation was resolved, at least for now, Rowan released the two elves.  They glanced at one another somewhat nervously, but showed no further signs of fear."

ro "Okay.  Right.  Draith, may I ask what brings you to my office?"

dra "Uh, oh!  I thought that since you were here that maybe I'd deliver my report in person?"

"Draith fidgeted with a parchment before looking sidelong at Liurial.  He started taking an instinctive step backwards but managed to put his foot back down.  That was progress, but Rowan wasn't satisfied with the answer."

ro "Is there anything in particular about this report you needed to bring up?"

#draith aroused
dra "No... I thought that maybe we could enjoy one another's company?"
