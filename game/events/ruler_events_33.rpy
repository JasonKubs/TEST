scene black with fade

"Sleep came to Rowan with a certain, lingering discomfort. The last few weeks had left him drained, exhausted of the endless minutiae of being a mostly-unwilling participant in the conquest of Rosaria for the Twins."
"He had fallen into bed that night with the weight of someone weary of responsibility of the waking world."
"And yet sleep did not come."
"When his head hit the pillow, he lay there for several hours, staring at the wall of his chambers in the vain hope that he might find peaceful slumber. It was only after a long period of inactivity that he started to notice something was… off."
"Rowan sat up, his head swimming as he realized the room had a hazy, dreamlike texture. He lifted his arm, and it moved like it was underwater. He blinked, and the texture of the room changed, beaming a warm, pulsating glow through the window."
"Rowan stood to his feet, waddling over to the strange light that shot an almost sunlike glare into the room. He tried to peer out of the castle window, but found himself staggering back as the light became a blinding inferno that engulfed him."
"Castle Bloodmeen fell away, the world fell away. Rowan fell into a pit of light as blinding as total darkness. He could not see, could not hear, could barely think with the endless luminescence filling his vision. He tried to scream, but the light blocked out even that."
"And just like that, he was elsewhere. The light dissipated, leaving Rowan to stare in blank incomprehension at the strange climate of his new surroundings."

"Rowan knew immediately that wherever ‘here’ was, was not anywhere in Solanse." 
"The woods around him were ancient: an endless series of dead trees with petrified bark, like rootless matchsticks made of a white, chalky texture. Their leaves were dark and crinkled, wafting black dust that almost seemed like soot into the air, dissipating into the mustard-yellow sky above."
"Above his head, tall, bulbous clouds roiled across the heavens. Even without inhaling the acrid stench of sulfur that hung in the air, Rowan knew that this was a dead world. There was something… missing in his vision of this place, something hollow."
"He felt a breeze ruffle his hair. It felt hot and humid, festering like the interior of a plague victim’s lungs. Rowan nearly gagged on the stench."

"The Dreamwalker’s smile was sad, but kindly. She sidled over to Rowan, pulling him into a side hug as she rested her head upon his shoulder. Together, they watched the pale, lightless sun work its way across the sickly sky."

hear "Welcome to our home, Rowan. Our true home. The final birthright of the Fae."

ro "...This is your original plane of existence?"

hear "Yes. It is. Or, maybe ‘was’ would be a better term for it? I do not know if time even works properly as you would conceive of it here."

ro "What happened?"

hear "Extinction. The slow decomposition of a comatose world."

ro "...Why? What caused this?"

hear "I do not know. I am not sure if there are any living Fae who do know. Our memories of this place - much like its original name, are lost to us."
hear "Even the oldest among us cannot recall a time when it was anything else other than this."

"Rowan watched as a thin brown cloud moved in front of the sun, casting them in the faintest of shadows. His heart caught in his throat as he feared for a half-moment that they would be plunged into total darkness, but the cloud merely meandered onward in its listless journey."

ro "What could have done this?"

hear "War? Disease? The Gods? Perhaps some poor, long-dead creature’s grand spell that went awry? We will never know for certain."
hear "All that we know is that this is where the Fae go when we die: this lingering perdition, a plane that has no soul. A world that has no God."
hear "We can never fully escape it, for we are the nature spirits that once gave this plane life. We are bound to this place, to its doom."

"Rowan could feel it: the quiet, sucking sensation that this profane environment inflicted upon him, even through the shroud of the dream. It was a quiet malaise: a low, queasy feeling that grew more intense with every passing moment."
"He felt nervous, fidgety and uncomfortable. It only got worse the longer he lingered."

ro "Does anything still live here?"

hear "They used to. There is some evidence of ancient settlement: sunken towns buried in the swamps, half collapsed towers in the distance, crumpled cottages with mouldering walls amidst skeletal fields. But nothing lives here, nothing grows."
hear "To a spirit of nature, this place is like a pestilence. There is nothing to tend, to nurture or sprout from. Everything here is…"

"The half-Fae trailed off, her long ears flicking as she stared at the hollow sun."

#heartsong neutral

ro "You almost sound like you pity them."

ro "..."
ro "Why are you showing me this, Heartsong?"

hear "To help you understand. This conflict between the followers of Sol and the Midnight Court, it's more than just a squabble."
hear "Sol is more to the Red Sun Alliance than some powerful ruler, or a deity to mindlessly worship. He is our salvation."

"The foxtailed Fae swept her delicate arm out, indicating with her hand the desolation that lay before them."

hear "Everything we are, everything we have accomplished in Solanse, is due to his influence. Even the Midnight Court themselves owe their lives to his mercy, despite their misplaced hatred for him. "
hear "He is the tether: the only means of bridging the gap, of bringing us back from this place. Without him? Without the Red Sun Alliance?"

hear "There is beauty in this life as well, Rowan."
